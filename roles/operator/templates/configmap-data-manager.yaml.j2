# This is deployed tot the DM namespace and provides configuration material.
# The configMap must have the same name as the application CRD,
# e.g. 'jupyternotebooks.squonk.it'.

# The 'data' section provides a 'dm-app.config' key
# with a value that's essentially a Python Configparser file using '='
# as key/value delimiter.
